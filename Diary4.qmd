# Diary: Policy application

## Summary

Remote sensing offers various applications for addressing urban issues, including: 1. Urban Expansion: Landsat data can help monitor urban growth and land use changes, enabling better management of urban development. 2. Air Pollution and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC): Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-5 data can be utilized to assess air quality and LULC changes, supporting policy decisions on pollution control and environmental protection. 3. Urban Green Spaces: Landsat and Sentinel data can be used to monitor and manage urban green spaces, promoting sustainable urban development. 4. Disaster Response: Sentinel-2 data aids in disaster management, providing timely information for emergency response and recovery efforts. 5. Flood Monitoring: Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is effective in detecting and monitoring floods, assisting in risk management and mitigation. 6. Forest Monitoring and Illegal Logging: Landsat data helps monitor forest cover and detect illegal logging activities, supporting forest conservation efforts. 7. Forest Fires: Landsat data can be employed to detect and monitor forest fires, informing firefighting and prevention strategies.

Policy challenges in implementing remote sensing data for urban solutions involve: 8. Combining remote sensing data with GIS datasets to create comprehensive solutions. 9. Reflecting critically on how to address urban issues using remote sensing, considering factors such as funding limitations, planning stages, responsible entities, required skills, and potential benefits. 10. Aligning remote sensing-based solutions with global policy documents, such as the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to ensure coherence with global agendas. Identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders in the planning and implementation process to ensure the success and sustainability of remote sensing-based solutions.

## Application

Application

Monitoring Urban Expansion and Land Use Change Problem: Unplanned and rapid urban expansion can lead to negative environmental and social impacts, such as loss of agricultural land, deforestation, and increased pollution. Policymakers need reliable data to manage urban growth and mitigate these adverse effects. Technique: Researchers in China used remote sensing data from Landsat images to monitor urban expansion and land use change in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 1990 to 2015 (Reference: Liu, Y., Li, Y., & Chen, Y. (2018). Monitoring urban expansion and land use/land cover changes in Beijing--Tianjin--Hebei region using remotely sensed data during 1990--2015. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment, 190(4), 210). They employed classification algorithms to analyze the changes in urban land, agricultural land, water bodies, and other land use types. This analysis provided valuable insights into the urbanization process and helped policymakers identify areas that require targeted interventions, such as preserving agricultural land and implementing sustainable urban planning practices.

Assessing Air Quality and Health Impacts Problem: Air pollution is a critical issue in many urban areas, with severe consequences for public health and the environment. Policymakers need accurate and timely information to develop effective policies for reducing pollution and protecting public health. Technique: A study in the United States used satellite-derived remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to assess the relationship between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations and respiratory hospital admissions (Reference: Kloog, I., Chudnovsky, A. A., Just, A. C., Nordio, F., Koutrakis, P., Coull, B. A., ... & Schwartz, J. (2014). A new hybrid spatio-temporal model for estimating daily multi-year PM2.5 concentrations across northeastern USA using high resolution aerosol optical depth data. Atmospheric Environment, 95, 581-590). The researchers developed a spatio-temporal model that combined remote sensing data, meteorological data, and land-use information to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatial resolution. The study provided evidence of the association between PM2.5 exposure and respiratory health issues, supporting the need for policies to reduce air pollution and mitigate its impacts on public health.

## Reflection

Remote sensing in policy making presents a fascinating and valuable approach to addressing various urban and environmental challenges. The ability to collect high-resolution data over vast areas and track changes over time provides a unique perspective that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve through traditional data collection methods.
What makes remote sensing particularly interesting is its versatility and adaptability. With a wide range of sensors and data sources available, it can be applied to diverse policy areas, such as urban planning, disaster management, environmental protection, and public health. The continuous advancements in satellite technology and data processing capabilities promise even more accurate and timely information in the future, further enhancing its utility for policy making.
One key advantage of remote sensing is its potential for integration with other datasets, such as demographic, economic, and social data. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of complex urban systems, enabling policymakers to make informed decisions that consider the interdependencies between various factors.
However, there are also limitations to remote sensing in policy making. Satellite data may be subject to errors, such as atmospheric distortions or sensor malfunctions, which can affect the accuracy of the information. Additionally, remote sensing data is often retrospective, meaning that it may not always be suitable for addressing immediate, real-time concerns.
Moreover, the effective use of remote sensing data for policy making requires expertise in data processing, analysis, and interpretation. This may present a barrier for some organizations or governments with limited resources or technical capacity.
In conclusion, remote sensing offers exciting opportunities for policy making by providing valuable insights into urban and environmental issues. Its versatility and integration potential make it a powerful tool for informed decision-making. However, it is essential to be aware of its limitations and ensure that the data is used responsibly and accurately, considering its potential errors and the need for complementary information. As technology continues to advance, remote sensing will likely play an increasingly important role in shaping policies that promote sustainable urban development and environmental protection.
